# PracticalML
This project is for the Coursera class Practical Machine Learning.

A series of random forest models were fitted with different parameters for ntree and mtry. 

The model with the fewest out-of-sample errors was selected to make predictions with the test set.

The rationale for the choices made and how the model was built along with the final model is contained
in the R markdown file. In addition, a model with fewer trees was compared to the best model
found during cross validation. This model made the same prediction. Consequently, it looks like
random forests do well even with a relatively small number of trees on the project dataset.
